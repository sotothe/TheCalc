## TheCalc

TheCalc is just a class project.

It is a simple calculator that supports parentheses and long claculations and long numbers.

The code consists of two parts:
* **C# part** that contains graphical interface and reads keys and makes the calculable string.

* **Python part** which is actually just the **eval** function and gets the calculable string and gives the answer as a string.
